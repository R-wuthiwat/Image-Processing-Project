# Image-Processing-Project
The project focused on building the application that contains logarithm operation and power operation. Logarithm operation and power operation manifests the frequencies of the image by replacing original values of the image with the logarithm or power values of itself. The user’s interface is created by using Java swing class. Our group wrote application on java language, because we want the application to be a multi-­‐platform application. We extend function of the application that user can apply the operation on partial part of an image. User can get more information of the image because our application gives before and after applied operation values of the mean and standard deviation. Also user can keep track of how many times that operations were applied to the image and how long that took the application to finish all the operation processes.
